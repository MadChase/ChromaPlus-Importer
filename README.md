How to use:

NOTE: I HIGHLY suggest making a backup of you map before running any script.  

-Put the skript in the folder with you difficulty.dat and your Environment.dat file  

-Name the file with env changes "env.dat" and the diff file you want to add it to "ExpertPlusStandard.dat" or change the 2 names in the file that say "ExpertPlusStandard.dat" to your file name.  

-Then open up the folder in VSCode and hit the Run button in the top left corner while the skript is open
